# Calculations
total_daily_flow = household_size * wastewater_per_person  # liters/day
total_volume = total_daily_flow * retention_time  # liters

# Convert total volume to cubic meters (since 1 cubic meter = 1000 liters)
total_volume_m3 = total_volume / 1000  # cubic meters

# Assume a rectangular tank
# Volume = Length * Width * Depth
# Rearranging for Length and Width assuming Depth is fixed
tank_length = (total_volume_m3 / tank_depth) ** 0.5  # meters
tank_width = total_volume_m3 / (tank_length * tank_depth)  # meters
